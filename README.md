# Patient Wait List Analysis

## Problem Statement

Hospital management needs a comprehensive analysis of the patient wait list to optimize resource allocation, identify areas for improvement, and ensure efficient patient care. They require insights into the distribution of case types, age profiles, and specialty-wise wait times to make informed decisions.

## Steps followed 
#### 1.	Data Collection and Preparation: 
Gathered data on patient wait lists including case type, age, specialty, and wait times for the latest and previous months.
#### 2.	Dashboard Design: 
Created a two-slide dashboard using visualization tools like Power BI.

1.  Included key performance indicators (KPIs) displaying the latest month's patient wait list count and the count from the previous month.

2.  Implemented filters for average and median to provide flexibility in data analysis in the following charts.
-	Donut chart: Illustrates the distribution of case types (Inpatient, Day Case, Outpatient).
-	Bar chart: Displays the age profile distribution across different time bands.
-	Multi-row card: Highlights the top 5 waiting list specialties.

3.  Line Chart: Illustrate the Monthly trend analysis of Day case, Inpatient and Outpatient.

4.	Created a detailed table showcasing the count of outpatients, inpatients, and day cases across specialties, age profiles, and time bands.

5.	Utilized filters for case type, time duration, and specialty name for granular analysis.


## Key Insights
### 1.	Page 1 (Summary)
-	KPIs provide a quick overview of current and previous month's patient wait list counts, enabling comparison and trend analysis.
-	Donut chart highlights the proportion of each case type, aiding in resource allocation and capacity planning.
-	Bar chart reveals age distribution patterns within different time bands, informing targeted service improvements.
-	Multi-row card identifies the top 5 specialties with the highest wait times, guiding prioritization of interventions.

### 2.	Page 2 (Detailed View)
-	The detailed table facilitates deeper analysis, allowing stakeholders to identify best and worst-performing specialties, age groups, and time bands.
-	Trends in case type distribution across specialties provide insights into patient demographics and healthcare utilization patterns.
-	Comparison of wait times for different case types aids in identifying bottlenecks and optimizing patient flow.


## Conclusion
The dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of the patient wait list, empowering hospital management to make data-driven decisions for optimizing resource allocation, improving patient care, and enhancing operational efficiency. By leveraging insights from Page 1 and Page 2, stakeholders can prioritize interventions, streamline processes, and ensure timely access to healthcare services for patients. Regular monitoring and refinement of the dashboard will enable continuous improvement in healthcare delivery.
